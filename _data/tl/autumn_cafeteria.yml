    - line: (Hmm… It's nice to read from time to time.)
    - line: (The library at the dorms isn't too bad, but sometimes it's noisy and uncomfortable.)
    - line: (But here with the classical music quietly playing, it's pure bliss!)
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Oh? Is that Shu-kun?
    - chr: Shu
      line: … It's Aoba.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Sorry to talk to you so suddenly, were you napping?
    - chr: Shu
      line: No. I had just closed my eyes to devote my concentration to the music.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Aah. I know this piano piece too, it's got a nice languid feel to it~
    - chr: Shu
      line: This is not a place to stand around and talk, Aoba. Why don't you go sit down for now?
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: It isn't… Since I'm here, could I sit with you?
    - chr: Shu
      line: … I don't want to accept that.
    - line: I suppose it's uncomfortable to be spoken to from a distance though. Do what you like.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Thank you. … Ah, the waiter brought you coffee.
    - line: While I have the chance, could I place an order as well? Could I get the same coffee, and five round breads to go?
    - chr: Shu
      line: Five? Do you like it that much?
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: No, they're for giving out. The round bread is a hit whenever I take it to work!
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: The dough is soft and chewy, and the more you bite into it, the sweeter it tastes, so you don't need to add anything to it!
    - chr: Shu
      line: Well, that's news to me. I've been here a few times, but I've never paid attention to it.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Really? Then you should try some ♪
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Waiter~, please give him one of the round breads. I'll pay for it--
    - chr: Shu
      line: No. I'll pay for it myself, I'll be the one eating it after all.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Is that so? I thought it would be a good opportunity…
    - chr: Shu
      line: An opportunity? For…?
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Ahh, I don't want to get off topic.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: What kind of book are you reading? It looks like a paperback, is it a novel?
    - chr: Shu
      line: It's a recently published commentary on Shakespeare's works. It has a reputation among literary scholars for its interesting interpretations, so I was curious to see what it was all about.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Ooh, so you read books like that? Doesn't it get in the way of your art?
    - chr: Shu
      line: "It depends on the content. 'Roadside Stone' is no better than the vulgar things people post to the internet. I try to acquire a higher quality perspective."
    - chr: Shu
      line: They say that art is an explosion, but an explosion requires a catalyst--the accumulation of study and honed skills.
    - chr: Shu
      line: By combining them, they take form. The ideal is to create something out of nothing, but I am not a god.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: … ♪
    - chr: Shu
      line: … What's with that expression of yours? It's sickening.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Hehe. I'm just glad that the aloof Shu-kun is talking to me ♪ It's been so long since we've talked about meaningless things~
    - chr: Shu
      line: My words are meaningless to you, then? … Listen, Aoba. I'm in a good mood today so I allowed you to sit with me but…
    - chr: Shu
      line: You are a spiteful traitor. I hope you don't get too familiar with me.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Isn't that mean~? We're friends despite it.
    - chr: Shu
      line: Non, do not mistake me.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Ah, the round bread has arrived~ Go ahead and eat it!
    - chr: Shu
      line: You better not be rushing me. Hmm, is it served with fig jam?
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Why not try it without the jam first?
    - chr: Shu
      line: I was going to. Shut up for a minute.
    - chr: Shu
      line: (munch munch)
    - chr: Shu
      line: Hoo, the butter is so fragrant.
    - chr: Shu
      line: The sweetness is just right. This flavor would go well with just about any dish.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: Hehe, I'm glad you said that ♪
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: I was hoping you'd like it. Shu-kun loves croissants, so I thought to myself, 'he would enjoy it'
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: But I'm surprised you haven't tried it before. Are croissants the only bread you eat?
    - chr: Shu
      line: I simply never thought of trying it. I just happened to find this place while looking for bakeries that sell croissants.
    - chr: Shu
      line: I didn't find what I was looking for, but I liked the atmosphere. I've been coming back ever since.
    - chr: Shu
      line: Whether it's a vacation or a national holiday, it's empty here, a true hole in the wall. It's the perfect place to spend some quiet time.

    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: I know what you mean. And just looking out the window with a cup of coffee is a nice change of pace.
    - chr: Tsumugi
      line: That's why it's such a shame it's closing~
  - Prologue 2:
    - chr: Shu
      line: fuck!
