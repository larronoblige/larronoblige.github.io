    - line: Edmé has told me about you, but I’ve been too busy to seek you out myself. Do you need something?
    - line: ... I look suspicious? Because I’m wandering around at night with a trashbag and gloves?
    - line: (Loud sniffle)
    - line: It’s not... suspicious... It’s not like I stole something from anyone... I-I’m just lost...
    - line: Can’t I carry around a trashbag...? What if I don’t have a purse? Am—Am I supposed to carry everything in my arms?
    - line: ... You don’t know why I specified theft? (Sob) W-Well, how else am I supposed to—to make sure you know I’m n-not stealing anything? I-I-I wouldn’t do something like that!
    - line: <i>S-S’il vous plaît</i>, I’m very trustworthy! I’ve never committed a crime in my life!
