An eccentric, aloof man. Grew up in a small, old European town, and lives unwaveringly by the knightâ€™s code of honor. After a string of unfortunate coincidences in his childhood, he believes that he is cursed, and that anyone who sees his face is bound to die a gruesome death. Got excommunicated from his town as a teenager. He gets extreme bouts of anxiety when his face is exposed, and wears some kind of mask at all times. Wants to prove his worth as a knight, through any means necessary.
