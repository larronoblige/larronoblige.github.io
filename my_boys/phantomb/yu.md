Unit leader. A friendly, smart man with manic tendencies. Has nigh infinite patience and love to give, and is very protective of the people heâ€™s close to. Genius inventor with a habit of making dangerous machines. Blew his left arm up as a child while toying with chemicals, and had to have it amputated just below his elbow. Struggles with his own self image and how he fits into the world, but hides it away for the sake of others. Wants to give the people he loves a happy, fulfilling life.
