A socially awkward American weeb. Has seen every seasonal anime for the past decade, and can recite any fact about them by heart. Is playing at least two mobages at once at any given time. Has spent his entire life locked inside his room, from inexpiable dehabilitating anxiety. Wants to live out his fantasy of being an anime idol, and prove that he can exist in society.
