A cheerful, ditzy man. Loves early 2000â€™s J-fashion, and has admired idols since he was a child. Works part time as a model and ambassador for an EGL brand. Was buried alive as a child, and the extended oxygen deprivation left him with permanent brain damage. He has difficulty speaking and has lost almost all of his ability to feel pain. Mostly communicates through various grunts, and is extremely claustrophobic. Wants to enjoy his time as an idol with his friends.
