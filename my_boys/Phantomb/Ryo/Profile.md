A quiet, melancholic man. Has a natural tendency to blend into his surroundings, and often goes inadvertently ignored by the world around him. Likes sweets and naps, and is often lazing about. Has gone unnoticed his entire life, including by his parents, leaving him to grow up entirely on his own. Has difficulty understanding most emotions and societal norms. Wants to spend his life around people who are happy.
